# Google-Using-Python-to-Interact-with-the-Operating-System
* I followed Google course in Coursera platform
* The most "interesting" files of this repo would be 
  * connection.sh; personal bash script to connect to virtualLabs
  * .pdf notes about the course, not really 'pretty' but functional for me. Also lot's of things done with the interactive python session during the course are noted here
  * Final project in case I 'd need to remember certain things
